<!-- A group project working in with another General Assembly student to create a React web application, across two days. The concept of the project was to get familiarise working with API. The project interacted with the OMDB API to fetch data about movies and display it on the web. This project was paired coded, so the coding was divided equally. The feature I implemented was using the Mapbox API to display cinemas around your location, after fetching the data from the Movieglue API. -->
