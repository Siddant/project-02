## Overview
React Film Database is a front-end web application that allows users to search for their favourite movies, view their details and find cinemas near them. We aimed to created a web application similar to IMDB website.

## Instruction

## Process
We started the project by seraching for API's which could be useful for us, after few hours of searching we decided to use the OMDB API. The API was used to fetch data about movies and these data were displayed on our application. We also wanted to use MovieQuotes API to generete a random quote from the movie, but we didnot recived the access key therefore we had remove this feature.
